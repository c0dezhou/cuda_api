1. **Single-threaded tests**
   
    a. **Basic functionality**: Validate if cuMemAllocHost correctly allocates pinned host memory of various sizes and data types. Ensure that the allocated memory addresses are valid.

    b. **Edge cases**: Test allocating zero bytes or a negative amount of memory, and check how the function reacts when trying to allocate more memory than available.

    c. **Error handling**: Verify that appropriate error codes are returned for incorrect byte counts, invalid pointers, etc.

2. **Multi-threaded tests**

    a. **Basic functionality**: Test cuMemAllocHost's behavior when called from different threads, ensuring each thread can independently allocate memory without impacting others.

    b. **Synchronization**: Test cuMemAllocHost with synchronized threads where each thread waits for the previous one to finish before starting.

    c. **Error handling**: Validate how cuMemAllocHost handles errors in a multi-threaded scenario, such as trying to allocate more memory than is available or allocating zero bytes.

3. **Multi-process tests**

    a. **Basic functionality**: Each process should independently allocate memory using cuMemAllocHost, and the test should verify successful allocations that don't impact other processes.

    b. **Inter-process communication**: Test behavior when memory allocated in one process is accessed by another.

    c. **Error handling**: Test how cuMemAllocHost handles errors in a multi-process scenario, like trying to allocate more memory than is available, allocating zero bytes, etc.

4. **Multi-stream tests**

    a. **Basic functionality**: Verify that cuMemAllocHost can correctly allocate memory used in different streams without impacting other streams.

    b. **Overlapping and synchronization**: Test if cuMemAllocHost can handle overlapping operations and synchronization of operations in different streams.

5. **Loop tests**

    a. **Basic functionality**: Test cuMemAllocHost in a loop scenario, where allocation and deallocation are performed repeatedly across different threads, processes, or streams.

    b. **Error handling**: Test how cuMemAllocHost handles errors in loop scenarios, such as what happens if you attempt to allocate more memory than is available repeatedly.

6. **Event-related tests**

    a. **Basic functionality**: Test cuMemAllocHost in scenarios where CUDA events are used for synchronization. Test if cuMemAllocHost can correctly allocate memory that can be accessed after a specific event.

    b. **Multi-stream synchronization**: Use CUDA events to synchronize operations in different streams that are dependent on the memory allocated by cuMemAllocHost.

    c. **Performance measurement**: Use CUDA events to measure the time taken by cuMemAllocHost to allocate memory.

    d. **Error handling**: Test how cuMemAllocHost handles errors in event-related scenarios.

7. **Combined scenarios**

    a. **Multi-threading, multi-processing, and multi-streaming**: Test cuMemAllocHost in combined scenarios, such as multi-threading and multi-streaming, or multi-processing and multi-streaming.

    b. **Event, multi-threading, multi-processing, and multi-streaming**: Test cuMemAllocHost in combined scenarios, such as multi-threading and multi-streaming with events, or multi-processing and multi-streaming with events.

8. **API interactions**

    a. **Interaction with other CUDA driver APIs**: Test how cuMemAllocHost interacts with other CUDA driver APIs. Test if cuMemAllocHost can correctly allocate memory that can be accessed by cuMemcpy or other CUDA APIs.

9. **Performance**

    a. **Memory allocation speed (continued)**: Measure the performance of cuMemAllocHost under different conditions, such as different memory sizes, different numbers of threads/processes/streams, and with or without synchronization events.

10. **Stress Tests**

    a. **High Load**: Test how cuMemAllocHost performs under high load, such as continuous memory allocation and deallocation over an extended period.

    b. **Resource Limitation**: Test the behavior of cuMemAllocHost when system resources are limited or being heavily used by other processes.

11. **Security Tests**

    a. **Access Violation**: Test if cuMemAllocHost properly prevents unauthorized access to the allocated memory.

    b. **Data Integrity**: Test if cuMemAllocHost maintains data integrity, i.e., if the data written to the allocated memory can be read back without any corruption.

12. **Memory Leak Tests**

    a. **Memory Release**: After the allocated memory is no longer needed, test if it is correctly freed and if the system memory usage goes back to the expected level.

    b. **Repeated Allocation and Deallocation**: Repeatedly allocate and deallocate memory, and monitor system memory usage to check for potential memory leaks.
